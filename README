Inventory file: /etc/ansible/hosts
In this example files: inventories/

Tip: In Ansible 1.2 or later the group_vars/ and host_vars/ directories can exist in the playbook directory OR the inventory directory. If both paths exist, variables in the playbook directory will override variables set in the inventory directory.

Happening other way around for above statement



Tip: Keeping your inventory file and variables in a git repo (or other version control) is an excellent way to track changes to your inventory and host variables.

Example Run:
/home/walmart/ansible-multistage/playbooks: ansible-playbook -i ../inventories/dev_servers roles/test-var-role/tasks/my-playbook.yml
